Online Marketplace for used school books

---
## Description
This project idea arose during my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge.

The application will probably change and definitely get fleshed out in more detail, but in general it is:

1. Take the booklist from a school, using ISBN numbers to make sure that the edition etc of the book are the right ones. 
1. Check to see whether the teacher allows used or e-books for that particular book/edition. If so, then it will be highlighted.
1. Parents or other students can then say which of these books they want to sell. 
1. A parent looking for a used book for the next year can then reserve or buy the used book.
